  The tracert utility is used to trace the path taken by TCP/IP packets to a remote computer. It traces and reports each router or gateway crossed by a TCP/IP packet on its way to the remote host. The tracert utility can be used with the target computer's name or IP address. It is used to detect and resolve network connection problems. Answer C is incorrect. The ipconfig command-line utility displays the current TCP/IP configuration, such as the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and so on of a networked computer. Answer D is incorrect. The nslookup is a tool for diagnosing and troubleshooting Domain Name System (DNS) problems. It performs its function by sending queries to the DNS server and obtaining detailed responses at the command prompt.

  // the question correctly
  A solid-state drive (SSD) uses solid-state memory to store persistent data. SSDs are different from traditional hard disk drives (HDDs), because they have no moving parts, meaning they do not use a read/write assembly. They are not as fragile as magnetic hard drives and are typically less susceptible to physical shock. They are quieter, faster, more reliable, and require less power than magnetic drives.
