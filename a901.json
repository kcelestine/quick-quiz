Hubs are very simple device and possess no decision-making capability. They simply repeat and forward the data received on one port to all the other ports. There are two primary types of hub: passive and active. A passive hub sends received signals out through all of its ports except the one through which the signal was received. It does not amplify or regenerate the signal, as it does not have its own power source. This type of hub is used mainly to provide communication flow through the network. An active hub also sends data out all of its ports except the one through which the signal was received, but amplifies or regenerates the signal, as it sends it out the ports. Therefore, it does require electricity to operate. It can effectively double the length of the network segment. For example, you can extend an Ethernet segment to 200 meters (656 feet), rather than its usual 100 meters (328 feet), by placing a hub at the midpoint of the segment."
